										<h3>
											Children should develop and acquire a certain set of basic skills and 
											abilities as they grow under normal circumstances from their immediate environment 
											and when socialising with people at home, school, and with friends. And as they grow, they should 
											understand, process and respond to information as appropriate without much difficulty 
											over time. They should be able to perform similar tasks like their peers at definite 
											age ranges such as learning and recognising letters, simple words, numbers, sounds and 
											following basic instructions at Pre-school age., Connecting, remembering and 
											differentiating letters, words, numbers and sounds as well as reading, doing 
											mathematical operations and learning new skills that requires physical and 
											cognitive coordination as they grow older at Primary school age. However, 
											when a child persist to have difficulties in demonstrating those sets of 
											basic cognitive and motor skills, despite access to appropriate learning 
											opportunities, average or greater intelligence and proper motivation, the 
											child might be having a condition referred to as Learning Disability or 
											Learning Disorder. This condition is known to vary in severity in children 
											likewise adults.

										A Learning Disability (LD) is a neurological problem that affects how a 
										child receives and process information. This affects how the child understands and
										responds to the information or task received. It does not mean that the child is not intelligent,
										the child just perceives things in a different way from the usual way. The most common 
										types of Learning Disability are related to difficulties in reading, speaking, writing,
										reasoning, comprehending and solving math.
