							<h3>
							
							Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) â€“ ADHD is a 
							neurodevelopmental disorder that affects learning, concentration and 
							behaviour.  A child with this condition has trouble settling down and 
							will constantly lose concentration focusing and completing a task. 
							The child being easily distracted, will often forget and lose track 
							of what he/she was doing and may eventually  abandon his work 
							unbothered. 
 

							</h3>
						</p>
					<br>
						<p>
							<h3>
							This disorder often triggers hyperactivity and impulsive behaviours 
							which affects the overall learning capabilities of the child, 
							that is, reading, writing, speaking, listening and math. 
							The child rushes to do things without thinking if it was right or 
							safe or careless and acts in disruptive ways. Sometimes, might be 
							very impatient, Ignoring instructions and disregarding permission 
							request.
							</h3>
						</p>
					<br>

						<p>
							<h3>
							Treatment of ADHD may include a combination of therapy, counselling,
							behavioural and remedial Education training. Treatment can vary 
							depending on the how complicated the symptoms, personality and 
							health condition of the child is but most children learn to manage 
							with the condition and go on to lead normal lives as they grow up.

							
							</h3>
						</p>	

					<br>
					
						<P>
							<h3>
							It has been discovered that other conditions like anxiety 
							disorder, specific learning disability, or autism may co-exist with ADHD. 
							Therefore, careful and extensive medical and educational assessment are 
							essential to eliminate the chances of other conditions existing. If any other 
							problem exists, it is then necessary to evaluate and treat the disorders along 
							with the treatment for ADHD.
