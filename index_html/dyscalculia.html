							<h3>
							
							This is a specific learning difficulty that affects the acquisition of 
							mathematical skills and reasoning.  A child with this condition has poor 
							memory for numbers, symbols, estimates, sequences, directions, patterns, 
							layouts, quantitative and visual-spatial information.  The organisation 
							of thoughts to perform basic maths operations and do simple mental math 
							can be a huge task for such child.  About 7% of the population of children 
							live with this  condition as revealed by some researchers, however, it 
							cannot be told which gender is more affected. While math can be boring 
							to some children who dislikes maths, the ones with dyscalculia find it 
							strange and confusing even when the interest is there. It is frustrating 
							to count, connect numbers  abstractly, retrieve data stored in the memory, 
							associating symbols with quantities, ordering numbers or fractions etc. 
							These are the notable signs of dyscalculia and most times the child will 
							want to avoid any math related task especially when sent errands or asked 
							for information regarding money, time, game score, phone number, address, 
							tuning a radio for a particular station and using a tv remote to mention a
							few. The whole concept of going about doing these seems very complex 
							to them and these affect their confidence. 

							</h3>

							<h3>
							The intervention a child with dyscalculia needs is special attention. 
							Math vocabularies will be very beneficial to such a child for instance, 
							using different terms to mean the same thing such as sum, total, whole, 
							entire, all, add up, together, amount etc. A specialist can help the 
							child with planned instructions, assessments and evaluations. 
							It is noteworthy that this does not mean that the child is a dullard 
							because there are other areas the child would show strength though the 
							aspect of math concepts and reasoning are weaknesses.
