							<h3>
							
							dysgraphia is specific learning difficulty that affects written 
							expression which impairs handwriting and fine motor skills. 
							A child with dysgraphia struggles to write  on straight lines and 
							apply the appropriate spacing between words or may have letters 
							scattered without the proper spacing. Often, some letters are omitted, 
							especially vowels in the writing. The manner in which the wrist, 
							body, or paper are positioned while writing usually look awkward. 
							As a result, will tend to erase or cancel most of the time and 
							these make the handwriting chaotic or  difficult to read.  

							</h3>
						</p>
					<br>
						<p>
							<h3>
							Writing is a complex process of generating letters 
							and words (patterns and ideas) of a language in an expected format. 
							It requires the coordination of thinking, processing the thought, 
							Transferring the thought to the hand and producing meaningfully ideas in form 
							of written expression. Inability to complete the sequence becomes a problem. 
							Also, difficulty controlling fine motor skills, sequencing the hand movements, 
							or controlling spatial accuracy can cause slow writing and non-language based dysgraphia. 
							
							</h3>
						</p>	

					<br>
					
						<p>
							<h3>
							Children with dysgraphia maybe bright with good verbal skills, vast vocabularies, 
							oral fluency, wonderful ideas but they are unable to transfer those ideas to
							the book because they find writing laborious, however, parents and teachers 
							expect them to write at the same speed as they speak and when they do not, 
							they may be mistakenly thought of as lacking motivation or being careless.
							
							</h3>
						</p>
						
					<br>
					
						<p>
							<h3>
							Dysgraphia can occur alone or with other learning disabilities and 
							disorders. Reconciling the needed support such as using alternative methods 
							rather than writing goes a long way to help such children. Examples are reducing 
							written workload, providing handouts, conducting assessment with technological 
							based devices etc. In this case, the motor skills demand is put aside as long as 
							knowledge is attained.
